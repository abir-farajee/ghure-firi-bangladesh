Ghure Firi Bangladesh is a one-stop tourism solution. Here customers can plan their whole trip using just a single application and integrated website with it. First, customers will be able to select their destination for the tour. Then for that destination, they will be able to save their tour budget. On the basics of their budget, we will show them tour packages. Also, customers will have the option to make their custom package. The package will include an up-down train or bus, or airplane ticket. Also, they will have accommodations, food, and rent-a-car service. And based on their tour destination, there will be options for local tourist spots in that area to visit. All of this in just a single application and integrated website with it. They can use our package to avail of all this service or go into our application or web portal and make their custom package, including these services. They will be able to pay for all of this at once using their credit/debit card. While on the trip, we will provide our customers with a real-time map service to trace their trip plans in real-time. They will get a notification on completing their tour's small parts like lunch, spot visited, transportation, etc. Also, there will be a panel where they can see where they will go next in which transport and even where they will have their lunch.
